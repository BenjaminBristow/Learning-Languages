}


/* ******* Semi Colon ******
- A semi colon must be used after any line of code that doesn't start a block of code
- Example: if statements, functions, main functions, for loop, while loop are all starting blocks of code and do not need a ;
- Whereas printf statements, initialising variables and calculations all need a ; at the end of every line to tell the compiler that the line is finished
