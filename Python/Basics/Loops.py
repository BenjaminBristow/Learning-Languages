# A for loop repeats code a certain number of times

# range(5) means 0,1,2,3,4
for i in range(5):
    print("Number:", i)

# Loop through a string
for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)


# A while loop runs as long as a condition is True

count = 0

while count < 5:
    print("Count is", count)
    count = count + 1  # This increases count by 1
